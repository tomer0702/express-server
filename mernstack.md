The MERN stack is a popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page application.you will learn the MERN stack by building an exercise tracker.
The MERN stack consists of the following technologies:
MongoDB: A document-based open source database.
Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
React: A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).
It is also common to use Mongoose, which is a simple, schema-based solution to model application data.
We’ll be hosting our database in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas and Google Cloud Platform.
First we’ll review MongoDB and create a MongoDB Atlas account, then we’ll code the app.
Before we get into it, I want to let you know that this tutorial was sponsored by MongoDB



          1.MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database



MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).


            2.Express: Back-End Framework: 
            
Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs. Express supports many middlewares which makes the code shorter and easier to write.
                         

                         Why use Express? 

     1.Asynchronous and Single-threaded.
     2.Effecient, fast & scalable
     3.Has the biggest community for Node.js
     4.Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.
 

          3. React: Front-End Library 

             React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript and create UI components. 
                           

                            Why use React? 
     1.Virtual DOM – A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the original DOM. Any modification in the web application causes the entire UI to re-render the virtual DOM. Then the difference between the original DOM and this virtual DOM is compared and the changes are made accordingly to the original DOM.
    
    2.JSX – Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React. Makes it easier and simpler to write React components.
    
    3.Components – ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI. These components also promote code reusability and make the overall web application easier to understand.
    
    4.High Performance – Features like Virtual DOM, JSX and Components makes it much faster than the rest of the frameworks out there.
    
    5.Developing Android/Ios Apps – With React Native you can easily code Android-based or IOS-Based apps with just the knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS.
      
       You can start your react application by first installing “create-react-app” using npm or yarn. 

             4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment

          Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download. 

                                        Why use Node.JS? 
                  
                  1.Open source JavaScript Runtime Environemnt
                  
                  2.Single threading – Follows a single threaded model.
                  
                  3.Data Streaming 
                  
                  4.Fast – Built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.
                  
                  5.Highly Scalable
